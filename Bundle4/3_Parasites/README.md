# Parasites

## Task

Lost in a dangerous search and rescue mission you are stranded on an abandoned space station, deep in a foreign galaxy.
You skillfully maneuvered your spacecraft through the dangerous asteroid field, making split-second decisions and flying with impecable precision.
Searching through the remains of what once was a blooming civilization you suddently receive a nearby signal.
You pave your way through debris getting closer and closer to your destination, unknowing that there is an invisible threat lingering in the air...

An eerie atmosphere awaits you as you find your former colleagues sitting in a foreign looking control room.
As you start to investigate the bodies you realize they've been dead for months!
Just as you ask yourself what the source of the emergency signal was, the doors lock and you see hundreds of microscopic parasitic robots burst from the bodies.
Shocked you get cover behind a chair, noticing a terminal labeled with "Nanobots Control Terminal".
Your only chance in survial lies in reverse engineering the protection fast enough so you can disable the bot and escape from this hellhole.
